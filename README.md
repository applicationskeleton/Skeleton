Skeleton
========

Application Skeleton is a tool to generate skeleton applications easy-to-program, easy-to-run aplications that mimic a real applications' parallel or distributed performance at a task (but not process) level.

Application classes that can be represented include: bag of tasks, map reduce, multi-stage workflow, and variations of these with a fixed number of iterations.

Applications are described as one or more stages.

Stages are described as one more more tasks.  Stages can also be iterative.

Tasks can be serial or parallel, and have compute and I/O (read and write) elements.
