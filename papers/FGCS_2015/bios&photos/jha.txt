Shantenu Jha is an Associate Professor of Computer Engineering at
Rutgers University. His research interests lie at the triple point of
Cyberinfrastructure R&D, Applied Computing and Computational
Science. Shantenu leads the RADICAL-Cybertools
(http://radical-cybertools.github.com) project which are a suite of
standards-driven and abstractions-based tools used to support
large-scale science and engineering applications. Away from work, Jha
tries middle-distance running and biking, tends to indulge in random
musings as an economics-junky, and tries to use his copious amounts of
free time with a conscience.
