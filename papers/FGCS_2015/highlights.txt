Skeleton Applications represent the key parameters of parallel and distributed eScience applications.

Skeleton Applications are easy-to-program, easy-to-build, and easy-to-use, and easy-to-share.

Skeleton Applications have similar performance to the real applications on which they are based.

Skeletons Application are built from an open source: https://github.com/applicationskeleton/Skeleton

Skeleton Applications can be used to demonstrate system optimizations.
